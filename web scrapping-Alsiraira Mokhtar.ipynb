      "Text Content:  Machine learning is a branch of artificial intelligence (AI) and computer science which focuses on the use of data and algorithms to imitate the way that humans learn, gradually improving its accuracy.\n",
      "IBM has a rich history with machine learning. One of its own, Arthur Samuel, is credited for coining the term, “machine learning” with his research (link resides outside ibm.com) around the game of checkers. Robert Nealey, the self-proclaimed checkers master, played the game on an IBM 7094 computer in 1962, and he lost to the computer. Compared to what can be done today, this feat seems trivial, but it’s considered a major milestone in the field of artificial intelligence.\n",
      "Over the last couple of decades, the technological advances in storage and processing power have enabled some innovative products based on machine learning, such as Netflix’s recommendation engine and self-driving cars.\n",
      "Machine learning is an important component of the growing field of data science. Through the use of statistical methods, algorithms are trained to make classifications or predictions, and to uncover key insights in data mining projects. These insights subsequently drive decision making within applications and businesses, ideally impacting key growth metrics. As big data continues to expand and grow, the market demand for data scientists will increase. They will be required to help identify the most relevant business questions and the data to answer them.\n",
      "Machine learning algorithms are typically created using frameworks that accelerate solution development, such as TensorFlow and PyTorch.\n",
      "Subscribe to IBM newsletters\n",
      "Since deep learning and machine learning tend to be used interchangeably, it’s worth noting the nuances between the two. Machine learning, deep learning, and neural networks are all sub-fields of artificial intelligence. However, neural networks is actually a sub-field of machine learning, and deep learning is a sub-field of neural networks.\n",
      "The way in which deep learning and machine learning differ is in how each algorithm learns. \"Deep\" machine learning can use labeled datasets, also known as supervised learning, to inform its algorithm, but it doesn’t necessarily require a labeled dataset. Deep learning can ingest unstructured data in its raw form (e.g., text or images), and it can automatically determine the set of features which distinguish different categories of data from one another. This eliminates some of the human intervention required and enables the use of larger data sets. You can think of deep learning as \"scalable machine learning\" as Lex Fridman notes in this MIT lecture (link resides outside ibm.com).\n",
      "Classical, or \"non-deep\", machine learning is more dependent on human intervention to learn. Human experts determine the set of features to understand the differences between data inputs, usually requiring more structured data to learn.\n",
      "Neural networks, or artificial neural networks (ANNs), are comprised of node layers, containing an input layer, one or more hidden layers, and an output layer. Each node, or artificial neuron, connects to another and has an associated weight and threshold. If the output of any individual node is above the specified threshold value, that node is activated, sending data to the next layer of the network. Otherwise, no data is passed along to the next layer of the network by that node. The “deep” in deep learning is just referring to the number of layers in a neural network. A neural network that consists of more than three layers—which would be inclusive of the input and the output—can be considered a deep learning algorithm or a deep neural network. A neural network that only has three layers is just a basic neural network.\n",
      "Deep learning and neural networks are credited with accelerating progress in areas such as computer vision, natural language processing, and speech recognition.\n",

      "UC Berkeley (link resides outside ibm.com) breaks out the learning system of a machine learning algorithm into three main parts.\n",
      "Machine learning models fall into three primary categories.\n",
      "Supervised learning, also known as supervised machine learning, is defined by its use of labeled datasets to train algorithms to classify data or predict outcomes accurately. As input data is fed into the model, the model adjusts its weights until it has been fitted appropriately. This occurs as part of the cross validation process to ensure that the model avoids overfitting or underfitting. Supervised learning helps organizations solve a variety of real-world problems at scale, such as classifying spam in a separate folder from your inbox. Some methods used in supervised learning include neural networks, naïve bayes, linear regression, logistic regression, random forest, and support vector machine (SVM).\n",
      "Unsupervised learning, also known as unsupervised machine learning, uses machine learning algorithms to analyze and cluster unlabeled datasets. These algorithms discover hidden patterns or data groupings without the need for human intervention. This method’s ability to discover similarities and differences in information make it ideal for exploratory data analysis, cross-selling strategies, customer segmentation, and image and pattern recognition. It’s also used to reduce the number of features in a model through the process of dimensionality reduction. Principal component analysis (PCA) and singular value decomposition (SVD) are two common approaches for this. Other algorithms used in unsupervised learning include neural networks, k-means clustering, and probabilistic clustering methods.\n",
      "Semi-supervised learning offers a happy medium between supervised and unsupervised learning. During training, it uses a smaller labeled data set to guide classification and feature extraction from a larger, unlabeled data set. Semi-supervised learning can solve the problem of not having enough labeled data for a supervised learning algorithm. It also helps if it’s too costly to label enough data. \n",
      "For a deep dive into the differences between these approaches, check out \"Supervised vs. Unsupervised Learning: What's the Difference?\"\n",
      "Reinforcement machine learning is a machine learning model that is similar to supervised learning, but the algorithm isn’t trained using sample data. This model learns as it goes by using trial and error. A sequence of successful outcomes will be reinforced to develop the best recommendation or policy for a given problem.\n",
      "The IBM Watson® system that won the Jeopardy! challenge in 2011 is a good example. The system used reinforcement learning to learn when to attempt an answer (or question, as it were), which square to select on the board, and how much to wager—especially on daily doubles.\n",
      "Learn more about reinforcement learning      \n",
      "A number of machine learning algorithms are commonly used. These include:\n",
      "Here are just a few examples of machine learning you might encounter every day:\n",
      "Speech recognition: It is also known as automatic speech recognition (ASR), computer speech recognition, or speech-to-text, and it is a capability which uses natural language processing (NLP) to translate human speech into a written format. Many mobile devices incorporate speech recognition into their systems to conduct voice search—e.g. Siri—or improve accessibility for texting.\n",
      "Customer service:  Online chatbots are replacing human agents along the customer journey, changing the way we think about customer engagement across websites and social media platforms. Chatbots answer frequently asked questions (FAQs) about topics such as shipping, or provide personalized advice, cross-selling products or suggesting sizes for users. Examples include virtual agents on e-commerce sites; messaging bots, using Slack and Facebook Messenger; and tasks usually done by virtual assistants and voice assistants.\n",
      "Computer vision: This AI technology enables computers to derive meaningful information from digital images, videos, and other visual inputs, and then take the appropriate action. Powered by convolutional neural networks, computer vision has applications in photo tagging on social media, radiology imaging in healthcare, and self-driving cars in the automotive industry. \n",
      "Recommendation engines: Using past consumption behavior data, AI algorithms can help to discover data trends that can be used to develop more effective cross-selling strategies. This approach is used by online retailers to make relevant product recommendations to customers during the checkout process.\n",
      "Automated stock trading: Designed to optimize stock portfolios, AI-driven high-frequency trading platforms make thousands or even millions of trades per day without human intervention.\n",
      "Fraud detection: Banks and other financial institutions can use machine learning to spot suspicious transactions. Supervised learning can train a model using information about known fraudulent transactions. Anomaly detection can identify transactions that look atypical and deserve further investigation.\n",
      "As machine learning technology has developed, it has certainly made our lives easier. However, implementing machine learning in businesses has also raised a number of ethical concerns about AI technologies. Some of these include:\n",
      "While this topic garners a lot of public attention, many researchers are not concerned with the idea of AI surpassing human intelligence in the near future. Technological singularity is also referred to as strong AI or superintelligence. Philosopher Nick Bostrum defines superintelligence as “any intellect that vastly outperforms the best human brains in practically every field, including scientific creativity, general wisdom, and social skills.” Despite the fact that superintelligence is not imminent in society, the idea of it raises some interesting questions as we consider the use of autonomous systems, like self-driving cars. It’s unrealistic to think that a driverless car would never have an accident, but who is responsible and liable under those circumstances? Should we still develop autonomous vehicles, or do we limit this technology to semi-autonomous vehicles which help people drive safely? The jury is still out on this, but these are the types of ethical debates that are occurring as new, innovative AI technology develops.\n",
      "While a lot of public perception of artificial intelligence centers around job losses, this concern should probably be reframed. With every disruptive, new technology, we see that the market demand for specific job roles shifts. For example, when we look at the automotive industry, many manufacturers, like GM, are shifting to focus on electric vehicle production to align with green initiatives. The energy industry isn’t going away, but the source of energy is shifting from a fuel economy to an electric one.\n",
      "In a similar way, artificial intelligence will shift the demand for jobs to other areas. There will need to be individuals to help manage AI systems. There will still need to be people to address more complex problems within the industries that are most likely to be affected by job demand shifts, such as customer service. The biggest challenge with artificial intelligence and its effect on the job market will be helping people to transition to new roles that are in demand.\n",
      "Privacy tends to be discussed in the context of data privacy, data protection, and data security. These concerns have allowed policymakers to make more strides in recent years. For example, in 2016, GDPR legislation was created to protect the personal data of people in the European Union and European Economic Area, giving individuals more control of their data. In the United States, individual states are developing policies, such as the California Consumer Privacy Act (CCPA), which was introduced in 2018 and requires businesses to inform consumers about the collection of their data. Legislation such as this has forced companies to rethink how they store and use personally identifiable information (PII). As a result, investments in security have become an increasing priority for businesses as they seek to eliminate any vulnerabilities and opportunities for surveillance, hacking, and cyberattacks.\n",
      "Instances of bias and discrimination across a number of machine learning systems have raised many ethical questions regarding the use of artificial intelligence. How can we safeguard against bias and discrimination when the training data itself may be generated by biased human processes? While companies typically have good intentions for their automation efforts, Reuters (link resides outside ibm.com) highlights some of the unforeseen consequences of incorporating AI into hiring practices. In their effort to automate and simplify a process, Amazon unintentionally discriminated against job candidates by gender for technical roles, and the company ultimately had to scrap the project. Harvard Business Review (link resides outside ibm.com) has raised other pointed questions about the use of AI in hiring practices, such as what data you should be able to use when evaluating a candidate for a role.\n",
      "Bias and discrimination aren’t limited to the human resources function either; they can be found in a number of applications from facial recognition software to social media algorithms.\n",
      "As businesses become more aware of the risks with AI, they’ve also become more active in this discussion around AI ethics and values. For example, IBM has sunset its general purpose facial recognition and analysis products. IBM CEO Arvind Krishna wrote: “IBM firmly opposes and will not condone uses of any technology, including facial recognition technology offered by other vendors, for mass surveillance, racial profiling, violations of basic human rights and freedoms, or any purpose which is not consistent with our values and Principles of Trust and Transparency.”\n",
      "Since there isn’t significant legislation to regulate AI practices, there is no real enforcement mechanism to ensure that ethical AI is practiced. The current incentives for companies to be ethical are the negative repercussions of an unethical AI system on the bottom line. To fill the gap, ethical frameworks have emerged as part of a collaboration between ethicists and researchers to govern the construction and distribution of AI models within society. However, at the moment, these only serve to guide. Some research (link resides outside ibm.com) shows that the combination of distributed responsibility and a lack of foresight into potential consequences aren’t conducive to preventing harm to society.\n",

      "Text Content:  Machine learning (ML) is a type of artificial intelligence (AI) focused on building computer systems that learn from data. The broad range of techniques ML encompasses enables software applications to improve their performance over time.\n",
      "Machine learning algorithms are trained to find relationships and patterns in data. They use historical data as input to make predictions, classify information, cluster data points, reduce dimensionality and even help generate new content, as demonstrated by new ML-fueled applications such as ChatGPT, Dall-E 2 and GitHub Copilot.\n",
      "Machine learning is widely applicable across many industries. Recommendation engines, for example, are used by e-commerce, social media and news organizations to suggest content based on a customer's past behavior. Machine learning algorithms and machine vision are a critical component of self-driving cars, helping them navigate the roads safely. In healthcare, machine learning is used to diagnose and suggest treatment plans. Other common ML use cases include fraud detection, spam filtering, malware threat detection, predictive maintenance and business process automation.\n",
      "While machine learning is a powerful tool for solving problems, improving business operations and automating tasks, it's also a complex and challenging technology, requiring deep expertise and significant resources. Choosing the right algorithm for a task calls for a strong grasp of mathematics and statistics. Training machine learning algorithms often involves large amounts of good quality data to produce accurate results. The results themselves can be difficult to understand -- particularly the outcomes produced by complex algorithms, such as the deep learning neural networks patterned after the human brain. And ML models can be costly to run and tune.\n",
      "Still, most organizations either directly or indirectly through ML-infused products are embracing machine learning. According to the \"2023 AI and Machine Learning Research Report\" from Rackspace Technology, 72% of companies surveyed said that AI and machine learning are part of their IT and business strategies, and 69% described AI/ML as the most important technology. Companies that have adopted it reported using it to improve existing processes (67%), predict business performance and industry trends (60%) and reduce risk (53%).\n",
      "TechTarget's guide to machine learning is a primer on this important field of computer science, further explaining what machine learning is, how to do it and how it is applied in business. You'll find information on the various types of machine learning algorithms, the challenges and best practices associated with developing and deploying ML models, and what the future holds for machine learning. Throughout the guide, there are hyperlinks to related articles that cover the topics in greater depth.\n",
      "Machine learning has played a progressively central role in human society since its beginnings in the mid-20th century, when AI pioneers like Walter Pitts, Warren McCulloch, Alan Turing and John von Neumann laid the groundwork for computation. The training of machines to learn from data and improve over time has enabled organizations to automate routine tasks that were previously done by humans -- in principle, freeing us up for more creative and strategic work.\n",
      "Machine learning also performs manual tasks that are beyond our ability to execute at scale -- for example, processing the huge quantities of data generated today by digital devices. Machine learning's ability to extract patterns and insights from vast data sets has become a competitive differentiator in fields ranging from finance and retail to healthcare and scientific discovery. Many of today's leading companies, including Facebook, Google and Uber, make machine learning a central part of their operations.\n",
      "As the volume of data generated by modern societies continues to proliferate, machine learning will likely become even more vital to humans and essential to machine intelligence itself. The technology not only helps us make sense of the data we create, but synergistically the abundance of data we create further strengthens ML's data-driven learning capabilities.\n",
      "What will come of this continuous learning loop? Machine learning is a pathway to artificial intelligence, which in turn fuels advancements in ML that likewise improve AI and progressively blur the boundaries between machine intelligence and human intellect.\n",
      "Classical machine learning is often categorized by how an algorithm learns to become more accurate in its predictions. There are four basic types of machine learning: supervised learning, unsupervised learning, semisupervised learning and reinforcement learning.\n",
      "The type of algorithm data scientists choose depends on the nature of the data. Many of the algorithms and techniques aren't limited to just one of the primary ML types listed here. They're often adapted to multiple types, depending on the problem to be solved and the data set. For instance, deep learning algorithms such as convolutional neural networks and recurrent neural networks are used in supervised, unsupervised and reinforcement learning tasks, based on the specific problem and availability of data.\n",
      "Deep learning is a subfield of ML that deals specifically with neural networks containing multiple levels -- i.e., deep neural networks. Deep learning models can automatically learn and extract hierarchical features from data, making them effective in tasks like image and speech recognition.\n",
      "In supervised learning, data scientists supply algorithms with labeled training data and define the variables they want the algorithm to assess for correlations. Both the input and output of the algorithm are specified in supervised learning. Initially, most machine learning algorithms worked with supervised learning, but unsupervised approaches are becoming popular.\n",
      "Supervised learning algorithms are used for several tasks, including the following:\n",
      "Unsupervised machine learning algorithms don't require data to be labeled. They sift through unlabeled data to look for patterns that can be used to group data points into subsets. Most types of deep learning, including neural networks, are unsupervised algorithms.\n",
      "Unsupervised learning algorithms are good for the following tasks:\n",
      "Semisupervised learning works by feeding a small amount of labeled training data to an algorithm. From this data, the algorithm learns the dimensions of the data set, which it can then apply to new unlabeled data. The performance of algorithms typically improves when they train on labeled data sets. But labeling data can be time-consuming and expensive. This type of machine learning strikes a balance between the superior performance of supervised learning and the efficiency of unsupervised learning.\n",
      "Semisupervised learning can be used in the following areas, among others:\n",
      "Reinforcement learning works by programming an algorithm with a distinct goal and a prescribed set of rules for accomplishing that goal. A data scientist will also program the algorithm to seek positive rewards for performing an action that's beneficial to achieving its ultimate goal and to avoid punishments for performing an action that moves it farther away from its goal.\n",
      "Reinforcement learning is often used in the following areas:\n",
      "Developing the right machine learning model to solve a problem can be complex. It requires diligence, experimentation and creativity, as detailed in a seven-step plan on how to build an ML model, a summary of which follows.\n",
      "1. Understand the business problem and define success criteria. The goal is to convert the group's knowledge of the business problem and project objectives into a suitable problem definition for machine learning. Questions should include why the project requires machine learning, what type of algorithm is the best fit for the problem, whether there are requirements for transparency and bias reduction, and what the expected inputs and outputs are.\n",
      "2. Understand and identify data needs. Determine what data is necessary to build the model and whether it's in shape for model ingestion. Questions should include how much data is needed, how the collected data will be split into test and training sets, and if a pre-trained ML model can be used.\n",
      "3. Collect and prepare the data for model training. Actions include cleaning and labeling the data; replacing incorrect or missing data; enhancing and augmenting data; reducing noise and removing ambiguity; anonymizing personal data; and splitting the data into training, test and validation sets.\n",
      "4. Determine the model's features and train it. Select the right algorithms and techniques. Set and adjust hyperparameters, train and validate the model, and then optimize it. Depending on the nature of the business problem, machine learning algorithms can incorporate natural language understanding capabilities, such as recurrent neural networks or transformers that are designed for NLP tasks. Additionally, boosting algorithms can be used to optimize decision tree models.\n",
      "Learn how the following algorithms and techniques are used in training and optimizing machine learning models:\n",
      "5. Evaluate the model's performance and establish benchmarks. The work here encompasses confusion matrix calculations, business key performance indicators, machine learning metrics, model quality measurements and determining whether the model can meet business goals. \n",
      "6. Deploy the model and monitor its performance in production. This part of the process is known as operationalizing the model and is typically handled collaboratively by data science and machine learning engineers. Continually measure the model for performance, develop a benchmark against which to measure future iterations of the model and iterate to improve overall performance. Deployment environments can be in the cloud, at the edge or on the premises.\n",
      "7. Continuously refine and adjust the model in production. Even after the ML model is in production and continuously monitored, the job continues. Business requirements, technology capabilities and real-world data change in unexpected ways, potentially giving rise to new demands and requirements.\n",
      "Machine learning has become integral to the business software that runs organizations. The following are some examples of how various disciplines use ML:\n",
      "Machine learning's ability to identify trends and predict outcomes with higher accuracy than methods that rely strictly on conventional statistics -- or human intelligence -- provides a competitive advantage to businesses that deploy ML effectively. Machine learning can benefit businesses in several ways:\n",
      "But machine learning also comes with disadvantages. First and foremost, it can be expensive. Machine learning projects are typically driven by data scientists, who command high salaries. These projects also require software infrastructure that can be expensive. And businesses can encounter many more challenges.\n",
      "There's the problem of machine learning bias. Algorithms trained on data sets that exclude certain populations or contain errors can lead to inaccurate models of the world that, at best, fail and, at worst, are discriminatory. When an enterprise bases core business processes on biased models, it can suffer regulatory and reputational harm.\n",
      "Explaining how a specific ML model works can be challenging when the model is complex. In some vertical industries, data scientists must use simple machine learning models because it's important for the business to explain how every decision was made. That's especially true in industries that have heavy compliance burdens, such as banking and insurance. Data scientists often find themselves having to strike a balance between transparency and the accuracy and effectiveness of a model. Complex models can produce accurate predictions, but explaining to a layperson -- or even an expert -- how an output was determined can be difficult.\n",
